# Low-level TODOs

- [x] create a scaffolding of the heap class
- [x] implement a max-heap
- [x] extend the implementation for a min-heap
- [x] create `median_1` and `median_2` calculators
- [x] heap as an array; start with size 4096
- [x] fix known issue: heap calc not implemented yet
- [x] fix the -0.5 problem in the heap algorithm
- [x] fix the -0.5 problem in the static algorithm
- [x] allow switching algos in makefile
- [x] push to github
- [x] add "known issues" section to readme
- [x] add known issue: can't accept data in large chunks
- [x] describe the dynamic (heap) solution in readme
- [x] describe the static (array) solution in readme
- [x] update the link to bats
- [x] rename `median_calc_2`
- [x] describe in readme how to build and run
- [x] increase range of accepted inputs for the static algo
- [x] remove the range limit of the heap algo
- [ ] after filling one memory page, each new heap level makes a realloc
- [ ] refactor key functions
- [ ] handle large chunks of input data
- [ ] switch from int to long int everywhere
- [ ] add test: `yes` input flood (like `yes "1 2 3 " > /dev/median`)
- [ ] add test: int32 limits
- [ ] add test: int64 limits
- [ ] think of, and add stress tests to challenge other limits
- [ ] test on different machines
